//Chris Martinez, Danny your coming along with the programs your creating, and recreating. I noticed that your not adding spaces between the Console.Write lines, but when you use spaces \n  it gives the program more context, even when looking to be a simple program. Besides all this, the program still serves the purpose, and runs. Spaces between lines, and a Then End note when performing the exit.
